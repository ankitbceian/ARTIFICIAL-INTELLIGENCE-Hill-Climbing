# ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE-Hill-Climbing
Hill Climbing is a classic optimization algorithm used in artificial intelligence and search problems. It's a local search algorithm that iteratively improves a current solution by making small, incremental changes and evaluating their impact. The goal is to find the best possible solution within a predefined search space.
